  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
    I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong curiosity for understanding
    how computing systems work beneath the surface. Rather than focusing on a single
    role or technology, I am interested in building solid fundamentals across core
    computer science domains.
  </p>

  <p>
    My interest in cybersecurity emerged as a natural extension of this curiosity.
    Studying security has helped me understand systems, networks, and software behavior
    from a deeper perspective — including how assumptions break, how failures occur,
    and how systems can be designed more robustly.
  </p>

  <p>
    I view cybersecurity not as an isolated career path, but as a lens through which
    broader computer science concepts such as operating systems, networking,
    cryptography, and software engineering can be explored and understood more deeply.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside security-focused exploration, I am equally interested in programming,
    problem-solving, and system-level concepts. My goal is to continuously grow my
    understanding of computer science as a discipline, keeping myself open to
    software engineering, systems roles, and research-oriented opportunities.
  </p>

  <p>
    This website is designed to reflect that learning journey — documenting areas I
    have explored, areas I am currently focusing on, and areas I am curious to explore
    further, without locking myself into fixed labels or premature specialization.
